# Diffuse_Light_Panel
 - This is a derivative work. See LICENSE.

## Principle Design
 - Design is a direct variation on '$40 DIY Cake pan light'. See LICENSE.
 - Rim the interior of a metallic container with 5-ft lengths of LED strip lights.
 - Use two LED strips: 1) warm color temperature, 2) cool color temperature.
 - Use 2-channels of dimming to allow for variable color temperature.
 - Cover the aperture with 2 layers of diffusion material.
 - Result will consume 10-ft total length of LED strip lighting.

## Future revisions
 - Future implementations should consider these changes for an improved product.
 - Dimmers use 10k (Ohm) multi-turn potentiometer. Depopulate and replace.
 - An externally mounted pair of potentiometers would improve the quality of life.
 - Affix a standard barrel jack to power the lights rather than direct soldering.
 - Power button / switch (12 V, (4 to 6) A minimum rating). 

## Revision 3
 - Built revision 2 in a aluminum, 12-inch circular cake pan.
 - Absence of sharp corners improved ease of applying the LED strips.
 - Recessing the LED strips as deeply as possible is encouraged.
 - Recessing the strips improves lighting uniformity (as one should expect).

## Revision 2
 - Applied 2 layers of the specified diffusion material.
 - SUBSTANTIAL improvement of lighting uniformity. Highly recommended.

## Revision 1
 - Moved to a switch-mode (more-or-less) constant current dimmer.
 - Dimmer requires many turns required before noticeable dimming.
 - Screw terminals on dimmer ineffective. Soldered wires directly to pads.
 - Scan-line artifacts resolved / not noticeable.
 - Moved to a cardboard box lined with printer paper: Acceptable.

## Revision 0
 - Non-Stick bread pan used as container. Aperture: acceptable, AVOID NON-STICK CONTAINERS.
 - (Cheap) PWM Dimmer was used, renders the light incompatible with videography.
 - Scan-line artifacts emerge from the interaction of the PWM and the image sensor.
 - Without dimmer, 2 strips of LEDs draw a (combined) (4 to 5) A at 12 V, (50 to 60) W.
 - At full power, these LEDs get HOT. Intended brightness achieved near 1 A combined.
